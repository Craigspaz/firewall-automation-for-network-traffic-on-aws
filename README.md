# Solution Overview
Solution for AWS Network Firewall Deployment Automations for AWS Transit Gateway.

<a name="architecture-diagram"></a>
# Architecture Diagram
![Architecture Diagram](./source/architecture.png)

<a name="prerequisites-for-customization"></a>
## Prerequisites for Customization
* Node.js>12

<a name="build"></a>
## Build
Build the CDK code
```
cd source/
npm run build
```

Build the Network Firewall Solution CodeBuild source code
```
cd source/networkfirewallAutomation
tsc 
```

Build the templates for custom deployments

```
cd deployments/
chmod +x ./build-s3-dist.sh
./build-s3-dist.sh [SOLUTION_DIST_BUCKET] network-firewall-automation [VERSION_ID]
```

<a name="unit-test"></a>
## Unit Test
Run the unit tests 

```
cd source/
chmod +x ./run-all-tests.sh
```

<a name="deploy"></a>
## Deploy
Follow the steps for deploying your custom version of the solution.
* Create an S3 bucket with the bucket appended with the region in which the deployment is to be made. example, if the deployment is to be made in us-east-1 create a bucket name as [BUCKET_NAME]-us-east-1.
* Create the distribution files using the script provided in the build section above.
* Create the S3 Key in the bucket network-firewall-automation/[VERSION_ID]/
* Create the S3 Key in the bucket network-firewall-automation/latest/
* Copy the file ./deployment/regional-s3-assets/network-firewall-automation.zip to the location s3://[BUCKET_NAME]-[REGION]/network-firewall-automation/[VERSION_ID]/
* Copy the file ./deployment/regional-s3-assets/network-firewall-configuration.zip to the location s3://[BUCKET_NAME]-[REGION]/network-firewall-automation/latest/

Once the above steps are completed, use the file ./deployment/global-s3-assets/aws-network-firewall-deployment-automations-for-aws-transit-gateway.template to create a stack in CloudFormation.
